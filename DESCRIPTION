Description: The Sequence Read Archive (SRA) is the largest public
  repository of sequencing data from the next generation of sequencing
  platforms including Roche 454 GS System, Illumina Genome Analyzer,
  Applied Biosystems SOLiD System, Helicos Heliscope, and
  others. However, finding data of interest can be challenging using
  current tools. SRAdb is an attempt to make access to the metadata
  associated with submission, study, sample, experiment and run much
  more feasible. This is accomplished by parsing all the NCBI SRA
  metadata into a SQLite database that can be stored and queried
  locally. Fulltext search in the package make querying metadata very
  flexible and powerful.  Fastq files can be downloaded for doing
  alignment locally. The SQLite database is updated regularly as new
  data is added to SRA and can be downloaded at will for the most
  up-to-date metadata.
